    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. \n",
    ">Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/reviews_ex.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=40%>\n",
    "\n",
    ">**First, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer.** We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the Word2Vec lesson. You can actually train an embedding with the Skip-gram Word2Vec model and use those embeddings as input, here. However, it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn a different embedding table on its own. *In this case, the embedding layer is for dimensionality reduction, rather than for learning semantic representations.*\n",
    "\n",
    ">**After input words are passed to an embedding layer, the new embeddings will be passed to LSTM cells.** The LSTM cells will add *recurrent* connections to the network and give us the ability to include information about the *sequence* of words in the movie review data. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finally, the LSTM outputs will go to a sigmoid output layer.** We're using a sigmoid function because positive and negative = 1 and 0, respectively, and a sigmoid will output predicted, sentiment values between 0-1. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the **very last one**; we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the loss by comparing the output at the last time step and the training label (pos or neg)."
